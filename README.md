# CS580_FinalProject
This repository contains implementations of algorithms for evaluating queries and line joins on database systems. The algorithms are developed as part of Final Project for the course CS580 - Query Processing on Database Systems. 

The repository includes:
1. A hash join algorithms for evaluating queries.
2. A simplified version of the Yannakakis algorithm for evaluating line join queries.
3. Datasets used for running experiments to evaluate the performance and correctness of the implemented algorithms.

The algorithms are implemented in Python and MySQL.
